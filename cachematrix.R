## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function is almost similar as makeVector, which creates a "matrix"
## vector, which is a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y){
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(invs) inv <<- invs
    getinverse <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned 
## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve
## the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)){
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    m <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(m, ...)
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
}
